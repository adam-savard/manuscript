                <div class="line"><span>Again he began to teach beside the sea. Such a very large crowd gathered around</span></div><div class="line"><span>him that he got into a boat on the sea and sat there, while the whole crowd was</span></div><div class="line"><span>beside the sea on the land. He began to teach them many things in parables, and</span></div><div class="line"><span>in his teaching he said to them: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he</span></div><div class="line"><span class="line-number">5</span><span>sowed, some seed fell on a path, and the birds came and ate it up. Other seed</span></div><div class="line"><span>fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly,</span></div><div class="line"><span>since it had no depth of soil. And when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since</span></div><div class="line"><span>it had no root it withered away. Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns</span></div><div class="line"><span>grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. Other seed fell into good soil</span></div><div class="line"><span class="line-number">10</span><span>and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirty and sixty</span></div><div class="line"><span>and a hundredfold.” And he said, “If you have ears to hear, then hear!” The</span></div><div class="line"><span>Purpose of the Parables When he was alone, those who were around him along with</span></div><div class="line"><span>the twelve asked him about the parables. And he said to them, “To you has been</span></div><div class="line"><span>given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything comes</span></div><div class="line"><span class="line-number">15</span><span>in parables, in order that ‘they may indeed look but not perceive, and may</span></div><div class="line"><span>indeed hear but not understand; so that they may not turn again and be</span></div><div class="line"><span>forgiven.’ ” And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? Then how</span></div><div class="line"><span>will you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word. These are the</span></div><div class="line"><span>ones on the path where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes</span></div><div class="line"><span class="line-number">20</span><span>and takes away the word that is sown in them. And these are the ones sown on</span></div><div class="line"><span>rocky ground: when they hear the word, they immediately receive it with joy. But</span></div><div class="line"><span>they have no root and endure only for a while; then, when trouble or persecution</span></div><div class="line"><span>arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. And others are those</span></div><div class="line"><span>sown among the thorns: these are the ones who hear the word, but the cares of</span></div><div class="line"><span class="line-number">25</span><span>the age and the lure of wealth and the desire for other things come in and choke</span></div><div class="line"><span>the word, and it yields nothing. And these are the ones sown on the good soil:</span></div><div class="line"><span>they hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirty and sixty and a</span></div><div class="line"><span>hundredfold.”</span></div>
